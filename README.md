# Background Changer

## Overview

Welcome to the Background Changer project! This project is developed by Wasee-Ur-Rehman as part of the third semester. The application allows users to perform batch image processing with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using SFML. Additionally, it utilizes TinyFileDialogs for batch image processing and saving. The project also includes functionality for image color changing using OpenCV.

## Features

1. **SFML GUI:**
   - The graphical user interface is built using SFML, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

2. **Batch Image Processing:**
   - Utilizes TinyFileDialogs for batch image processing and saving.
   - Users can select multiple images and apply background changes simultaneously and save it.

3. **Image Color Changing with OpenCV:**
   - Implements image color changing functionality using OpenCV.
   - Users can pick a color, and the application will replace the selected color in the image with a specified background color.
   - Users can input colors using **Color Picker** and **Textboxes**.

## How to Use

1. **Building the Project:**
   - Make sure you have , SFML, OpenCV, and TinyFileDialogs installed.

2. **Running the Application:**
   - Use the GUI to select images and perform batch image processing.

3. **Image Color Changing:**
   - Within the SFML GUI, follow the instructions for image color changing.
   - Pick a color using the Color Picker or input color values in the Textboxes.
   - The application will replace the selected color in the image with a specified background color.
